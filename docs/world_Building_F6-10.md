world Building floors 6-10

# Floor 6: The Waystation Veil (Interlude Floor)

## Tone & Scale
- Small, calm grassland ledge; muted dusk light, fireflies, slow breeze.
- Under 30–45 seconds traversal; no real combat pressure.

## Layout & Key Points
- Two standard Teleport Stones (entry south, exit north).
- **New Descent Stone** on a side knoll (east), one-way to any cleared prior floor.
- Eldrin seated by a low lantern near entry; Sunny Man lounging by the Descent Stone.
- Simple trader stall under a cloth canopy near center.
- 2–3 loot spots among rocks/wildflowers.

## Look & Feel
- Soft meadow grass, mossy stones, shallow stream or puddles, fireflies.
- Low, warm lanterns; dusky sky, distant silhouettes of higher floors above.
- Worn planks/stepping stones over small water patches; a single fallen log as a bench.
- Light wooden fences and cloth banners (faded greens/tans), not bright like Floor 1.

## Eldrin (returning)
- Gentle, reflective, supportive; frames harder climb ahead and the mixed world (written/grown/lived).
- Sample:
  - “Rest here. The meadow listens, even when the walls forget.”
  - “You’ve learned to carry more—skills, scars, questions. You’ll need all of them soon.”
  - “The Architect’s hand is code and root alike. Ahead, the lines blur harder.”

## Sunny Man (warm apology)
- Light, contrite, playful.
  - “Sorry for dreaming up mirrors that drop you. If you didn’t bite, wise paws. If you did—hope you stuck the landing.”
  - “No tricks here. Just grass, lanterns, and a tail trying to behave.”

## Descent Stone (new mechanic)
- Flavor: “A ring of soft green glyphs pointing down; it remembers where you’ve been.”
- Use: one-way to any unlocked lower floor; no upward travel.

## Trader (Meadow Vendor)
- Stock: umbra/clarity/mirror tonics, small buffs, one mid-tier skill gem; low-key dialogue.

## Lore Beats
- Floors as layered memories; descents are cached paths, ascents must be earned.
- The Architect as observer/warden; this meadow is a rare soft edge in a written world.
- Subtle glitch fireflies to hint the digital seam without breaking the calm.
