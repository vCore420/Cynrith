## 1. What Are Interactable & Trigger Tiles?

- **Interactable Tiles:**  
  Tiles the player can interact with (by pressing the A button when adjacent or on the tile).  
  Used for dialogue, rewards, lore objects, activating animations, and quest progression.
  the player will get a notifaction when near these tiles

- **Trigger Tiles:**  
  Tiles that automatically trigger an event when the player steps on them.  
  Used for story events, dialogue, warps (wip), frame changes (wip), or quest objectives.

## 2. How to Add Interactable Tiles

### **A. Define in `interactTiles.js`**

Add a new object to the `INTERACTABLE_TILES` array:

```javascript
{
    id: "statue_f3_1",
    map: 2,
    x: 14,
    y: 11,
    image: "assets/img/worldSprites/statue_01.png",
    spriteSheet: "assets/img/worldSprites/statue_01.png",
    imageW: 512,
    imageH: 480,
    rows: 3,
    cols: 8,
    animSpeed: 6,
    animOnTrigger: true,
    zIndex: 1,
    collision: true,
    notification: "Press A to activate the statue.",
    dialogue: [
        "The statue glows with a strange energy.",
        "You feel a memory echo through the stone."
    ],
    rewards: [
        { id: "memory_fragment", amount: 1 }
    ],
    sound: {
        enabled: true,
        file: "statue_activate.wav",
        type: "trigger"
    }
}
```

**Key Properties:**
- `id`: Unique identifier.
- `map`, `x`, `y`: Location on the map.
- `image`/`spriteSheet`: Path to image or sprite sheet.
- `rows`, `cols`, `animSpeed`, `animOnTrigger`: Animation settings.
- `zIndex`: 0 (below player), 1 (above player).

## 3. How to Add Trigger Tiles

### **A. Define in `triggerTiles.js`**

Add a new object to the `TRIGGER_TILES` array:

```javascript
{
    id: "echo_f3_1",
    map: 2,
    x: 14,
    y: 11,
    type: "dialogue",
    sound: { enabled: true, file: "echo.wav", type: "ambient" },
    dialogue: [
        "A Echo Flickers: 'Not all who climb return.'"
    ],
    oneTime: true, // Only triggers once
    rewards: [
        { id: "glitch_fragment", amount: 1 }
    ]
}
```

**Key Properties:**
- `id`: Unique identifier.
- `map`, `x`, `y`: Location on the map.
- `type`: "dialogue", "warp", "frameChange", etc.
- `dialogue`: Array of dialogue lines (for dialogue triggers).

## 5. Best Practices

- Use unique IDs for all tiles.
- Place interactable tiles at accessible locations (not blocked by collision).
- Use `oneTime: true` for single-use story events.
- Test notifications, dialogue, rewards, and sounds in-game.
- For quest objectives, reference tile IDs in your quest definitions.
